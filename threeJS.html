        /* set up camera
        There are a few different cameras in three.js. For now, let's use a PerspectiveCamera.

        The first attribute is the field of view. FOV is the extent of the scene
        that is seen on the display at any given moment. The value is in degrees.

        The second one is the aspect ratio. You almost always want to use the width of the element divided by the height, 
        or you'll get the same result as when you play old movies on a widescreen TV - the image looks squished.

        The next two attributes are the near and far clipping plane. 
        It is that objects further away from the camera than the value of far or closer than near won't be rendered. 
        
        */

        Next up is the renderer.
        In addition to the WebGLRenderer we use here, three.js comes with a few others, 
        often used as fallbacks for users with older browsers or for those who don't have WebGL support for some reason.
        */
        var renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();

        /*
        In addition to creating the renderer instance, we also need to set the size at which we want it to render our app. 
        It's a good idea to use the width and height of the area we want to fill with our app.
        In this case, the width and height of the browser window. 
        For performance intensive apps, you can also give setSize smaller values, 
        like window.innerWidth/2 and window.innerHeight/2, which will make the app render at half size.

        /*
        In addition to the geometry, we need a material to color it. 
        Three.js comes with several materials, but we'll stick to the MeshBasicMaterial for now.
        All materials take an object of properties which will be applied to them. 
        To keep things very simple, we only supply a color attribute of 0x00ff00, which is green. 
        This works the same way that colors work in CSS or Photoshop (hex colors).

        /*
        When we call scene.add(), the thing we add will be added to the coordinates (0,0,0). 
        This would cause both the camera and the cube to be inside each other. 
        To avoid this, we simply move the camera out a bit.
